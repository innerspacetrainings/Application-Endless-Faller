*Test project for applicants*: Requires **Unity 2019.4.20f1**. 

![example](Images/example-faller.gif)

## Goal 

Implement a simple endless falling game where the character must fall between platforms to stay on screen. 

- Don't spend more than 6-8 hours for working on it. 
- Concentrate on the gameplay experience, data structures, architecture and separation of concerns.
- Everything in the project is used for your reference, you can use any of the assets or completely remove all of them. 
- You aren't required to use custom assets, you can use unity default shapes, build your own, or put some cubes together to get a desired shape. *You won't be evaluated in your 3D skills*, instead **the subject of evaluation will be**:
    - The implementation of the requirements.
    - The code quality.
    - How you use the Unity Engine.

## Requirements

Read the [REQUIREMENTS.md](https://github.com/innerspacetrainings/Application-Endless-Faller/blob/master/REQUIREMENTS.md) before starting.

Remember to read both this *README* and the *REQUIREMENTS* before starting to work on the project.

## Implementation 

- Clone this repository. 
- Develop as you would do in a normal project. 
- Do not use copyright/third party libraries. 
- Upload this project to a public or private repository in your account and invite [Philipp Ottensamer](philipp.ottensamer@innerspace.eu) to it. 

## Delivery 

### Before implementation 

- Split the requirements into sub tasks and estimate the time it would take for each one.
- Send an email to <philipp.ottensamer@innerspace.eu> with your estimations. 
- Optionally, contact Vitaly Popuzin for requirements clarification. 

### Implementation 

- Functional build for x64 machines. 

### After implementation 

- Comment the execution time for each issue closed. You can also add some extra information explaining why a task took less or more time than the estimated.
- Review the project (what you learn, where you struggle, what you liked from what you did, if we should pay attention on a particular piece of the project). You can use the *Review.md* for this. 
- Tag the final commit as "Release". 
- Inform Vitaly Popuzin of the finished projects. 

## Evaluation criteria 

- Structure of the 
    - project (scene ordering, how you set up components, nesting, etc)
    - code (how you define entry points, connections between scripts and nest your logic)
- How and which software patterns you use
- Maintainability and cleanliness of your code 
- How you test your code
- Whole feel of the game and creativity
